Hi! I'm Remy, a developer with a focus in UI/UX, web development, and accessibility in programming. I am also an advocate for ADHD, LGBT+, and disability diversity in programming! While I am primarily focused on frontend development, I also have experience in backend work in languages such as... Java, C#, Python, C, and C++, and I love databases! 

Ask me about color palettes ðŸŽ¨ , typeface, and accessibility-friendly design! :speech_balloon: 

Catch me on Twitter @thepiedpyper to keep up with me as I participate in #100DaysOfCode to improve my Meteor.js and JavaScript, and my general skills as a developer.
